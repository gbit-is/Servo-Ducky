# test_servo_moment_timing.py



This here is a table in which I instructed a servo motor to move 180 degrees, in X amout of time, 
what the measured time was ( in the code ) and the ratio.

This shows there are clearly some limitations to my aproach, especially in very fast movements.  
However in for example  the first line, it was instructed to move 180Â° in 1 millisecond, which it ofcourse is not capable
of doing, the delay is the result of the code having to parse through the commands and issue instructions over I2C to the PCA9685 chip

In these tests, in practice with the servo I was using (cheap sg90) it took it at the very least 100ms to be able to actually move 
the 180 degrees, and the timing function was as I envisioned it to be used for slow movements, under the max movement possibility

once you go over 500ms, the
